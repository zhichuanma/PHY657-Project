parameters:
eff_SOEC: energy input/hydrogen output
eff_SOFC: hydrogen input/energy output
V_max: the tank capacity
P_SOEC: the max power rate of SOEC
P_SOFC: the max power rate of SOFC
P(t): electricity price at time t
t = 1,...

variables:
x1(t): binary, x1 = 1 if SOEC uses the electricity to produce the hydrogen gas, x1 = 0 if...
x2(t): binary, x2 = 1 if SOFC uses the hydrogen gas to produce the electricity, x2 = 0 if...
E(t): the electricity energy at time t
V(t): the hydrogen gas at time t

Objective: Total_cost = cost(Vmax) + sum(E(t)P(t))

constraints: 
# transition between hydrogen gas and electricity
E(t) = x1(t) * V(t) / eff_SOEC + x2(t) * V(t) * eff_SOFC

# either SOEC work, or SOFC work, or no work
x1(t) + x2(t) <= 1

# big M method
E(t) >= -(1-x1(t))M
E(t) <= (1-x2(t))M

# Tank Volume constraints
sum_1_t(V(t)) <= Vmax

V(t) <= Vmax
V(t) >= -Vmax

# tank is empty, at the exit
-V(t) * x2(t) <= sum_1_(t-1)(V(t))
 
# tank is full, at the entrance
V(t) * x1(t) < (V(max)-sum_1_(t-1)(V(t)))

# Power limit
E(t) <= P_SOEC * 1
E(t) >= P_SOFC * eff_SOFC * 1
